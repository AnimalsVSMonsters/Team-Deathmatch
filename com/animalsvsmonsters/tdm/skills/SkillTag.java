 * Every skill has a tag unique to it.
 * 
 * TODO: Do something more important with this, or replace it with classes?
 * Idk. 
 * This way is also easier.
 * 
 * If you add a skill, be sure to give it a tag here.
 * The skill will require a tag input anyways.
 * And I'll smack you if you use another skill's tag.
 * That would break lots of things.
